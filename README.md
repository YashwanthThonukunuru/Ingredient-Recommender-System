# Ingredient Recommender System

## Overview

This repository contains the project work for the Recipe Recommender System. The objective is to build a recommendation system that suggests ingredients to users based on their past recipe reviews. The system aims to enhance the culinary experience by providing personalized ingredient recommendations and recipe suggestions.

## Project Details

Used data from food.com, we've developed a recommendation system with the following features:

- **Top-N Ingredient Recommendations:** The system suggests the top-N ingredients based on users' recipe reviews.
- **Recipe Suggestions:** Users receive relevant recipe suggestions aligned with their ingredient preferences.
- **Ingredient Replacement:** Users can replace specific ingredients with suitable alternatives, adding flexibility to recipe preparation.

## Dataset

The dataset for this project is available on the [Kaggle competition](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/recommender-systems-2023/data) page and consists of two key files:

- `train.csv`: User recipe reviews, including user IDs, recipe IDs, dates, ratings, and reviews.
- `metadata.csv`: Recipe metadata, such as names, preparation time, contributor IDs, tags, nutrition information, cooking steps, descriptions, and ingredients.
